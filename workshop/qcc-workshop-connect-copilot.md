# Using Copilot to Query Images

In this section, you will use Copilot to perform natural language processing (NLP) to query the invoice data. 
   - There are some example prompts to start out with below, but feel free to experiment. 
   - This is a just a workshop environment with a small amount of test data; but imagine the innovations you can glean with your dataset! 
   - As always, remember that AI generated content is subject to some inaccuracy.

### Step 1: Use Copilot to search the invoices using natural language 

1. Using the same Microsoft Edge web browser, navigate to the [Microsoft 365 Admin page](https://www.microsoft365.com/). `https://www.microsoft365.com/`

2. Click on the Copilot icon from the left hand menu.
  - *Note: It is the smaller of the two Copilot icons on the screen, boxed in red in the picture below*

3. On the bottom-center of the page, use the search bar to ask natural questions of Copilot regarding the images.
