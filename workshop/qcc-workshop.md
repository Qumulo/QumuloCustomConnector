# Integrating Azure Native Qumulo with Microsoft Copilot

The workshop focuses on integrating Azure Native Qumulo with Microsoft Copilot by using the Qumulo Custom Connector to extract and load simulated invoices into Microsoft Graph. Participants will learn to configure Microsoft Graph, understand essential permissions, and import data, enabling Microsoft Copilot to utilize this data for answering questions. Instructions for setting up and connecting to the virtual desktop via Microsoft Remote Desktop are provided for both Windows and MacOS users.

#### Target Audience 

Solution Engineers, Managers, Software Engineers, Developers, System Administrators, DevOps Engineers, Integration Specialists, and Data Analysts across industries. No prior experience with Microsoft Graph, Copilot, Entra, or Azure Native Qumulo is necessary.

#### Duration

1 hour

#### Learning Outcomes

- Learn to configure Microsoft Graph.
- Understand essential permissions for ANQ and Microsoft Graph.
- Configure the data schema for indexing in Microsoft Graph.
- Define the layout for search results.
- Learn to import data into Microsoft Graph.
- Master the usage of the Qumulo Custom Graph Connector.

#### Overview 

In this hands-on lab, you will use the Qumulo Custom Connector to extract simulated invoices from an Azure Native Qumulo cluster and load them into Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Copilot will then use this data and natural language processing to answer questions about the invoices.

| Note: | Differences between a Copilot Custom Connector and a Plugin |  
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Custom connector** | Used to integrate Microsoft Copilot with external data sources and APIs, allowing it to fetch and interact with data outside of Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem |
| **Plugin** | Plugins extend the functionality of a software application by adding new features or capabilities, and can be used across various platforms and applications, not limited to Microsoft products. |
